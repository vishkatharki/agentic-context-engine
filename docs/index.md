# ACE Framework

**Agentic Context Engineering** — a framework for self-improving language model agents.

ACE enables AI agents to learn from their own execution feedback through three collaborative roles: **Agent**, **Reflector**, and **SkillManager**. Learned strategies accumulate in a **Skillbook** that makes every subsequent call smarter.

## The Learning Loop

```mermaid
graph LR
    S[Sample] --> A[Agent]
    A --> E[Environment]
    E -->|feedback| R[Reflector]
    R -->|analyzes| SM[SkillManager]
    SM -->|updates| SK[Skillbook]
    SK -.->|context| A
```

Each pass through the loop discovers new strategies, reinforces what works, and prunes what doesn't.

## Get Started in 30 Seconds

```python
from ace_next import ACELiteLLM

agent = ACELiteLLM.from_model("gpt-4o-mini")

answer = agent.ask("If all cats are animals, is Felix (a cat) an animal?")

agent.save("learned.json")
```

## Install

```bash
pip install ace-framework
```
