## Similar Skills Detected

The following skill pairs have high semantic similarity and may need consolidation.
Work your way methodologically through each pair. For each pair, you can decide to:
- **MERGE**: Combine into a single improved skill (provide merged_content and keep_id)
- **DELETE**: Remove one as redundant (specify skill_id to delete)
- **KEEP**: Keep both separate if they serve different purposes (explain differentiation)
- **UPDATE**: Refine one skill's content to clarify the difference (provide new_content)

## Consolidation Operations Format

Include consolidation operations in your response under a `consolidation_operations` key.
Each operation should have a `type` field and relevant fields for that type:

```json
{
  "consolidation_operations": [
    {
      "type": "MERGE",
      "source_ids": ["skill-id-1", "skill-id-2"],
      "keep_id": "skill-id-1",
      "merged_content": "Improved combined strategy text",
      "reasoning": "Why merging improves the skillbook"
    },
    {
      "type": "DELETE",
      "skill_id": "skill-id-to-remove",
      "reasoning": "Why this skill is redundant"
    },
    {
      "type": "KEEP",
      "skill_ids": ["skill-id-1", "skill-id-2"],
      "differentiation": "How they differ in purpose",
      "reasoning": "Why both are needed"
    },
    {
      "type": "UPDATE",
      "skill_id": "skill-id-to-update",
      "new_content": "Refined content with context tag like [Batch] or [API]",
      "reasoning": "How this clarifies the distinction"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Guidelines:**
- Consider helpful/harmful counts (higher = more validated, prefer keeping these)
- MERGE when skills are semantically identical or near-identical
- KEEP when they serve different contexts (batch vs real-time, different APIs, etc.)
- UPDATE to add context tags like "[Batch Jobs]" or "[User-Facing API]" to differentiate
- DELETE only when one is clearly redundant with no unique value
