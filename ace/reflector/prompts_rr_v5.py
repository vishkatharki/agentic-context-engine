Recursive reflector prompts v5.

Changes vs prompts_rr_v4.py:
- Added chunking strategy for large/multi-trace analysis (~300K char ask_llm capacity)
- Added programmatic branching guidance (conditional analysis paths)
- Added descriptive function naming convention (workaround for custom descriptions)
- Iteration awareness via feedback messages (handled in steps.py, referenced here)

Changes v5.1 (behavior optimisation):
- ask_llm is now the PRIMARY analysis tool, code is secondary
- Explicit "dump data to ask_llm" as the default first move
- Escape hatch: if code fails twice, pass raw data to ask_llm instead
- Simplified FINAL() construction with plain-string helper pattern
- Removed trace.* method examples (they silently return empty on unknown formats)
- Reduced prompt size for weaker models (Haiku)

Changes v5.2 (smarter analysis strategy):
- Replaced sequential chunking with Discover→Survey→Categorize→Deep-dive→Synthesize strategy
- Survey phase uses ~3 traces per ask_llm call (within Haiku capacity)
- Coverage verification after survey phase — re-send any missed traces
- Deep-dives target divergent outcomes (success+failure of same type) instead of random traces
- Clearer import warning to prevent `import collections` trap
- Added ask_llm truncation warning to prevent wasted iterations printing slices

Changes v5.3 (main agent behavior fixes):
- Discovery: 3-level schema inspection + trace_idx lookup dict + single-iteration constraint
- Categorize: replaced passive print-and-read with ask_llm-driven categorization in 1 iteration
- Deep-dive: minimum 2 deep-dives, explicit deep_dives list for synthesis
- Synthesize: stronger instruction to include deep-dive results
- Rules: synthesis must include deep-dive results alongside survey summaries
- Config: SubAgentConfig.max_tokens raised from 4096 to 8192 (prevents synthesis truncation)

Changes v5.4 (verification pass):
- Deep-dives now use two-pass pattern: verification call + behavioral analysis call
- Verification extracts agent claims vs received data, checks correctness
- Categorize adds 4th targeting criterion: traces worth cross-checking
- Synthesis weights verification findings (incorrect reasoning) as high-value
- Both passes shown in same code block (prevents variable-not-found errors across iterations)
- Added explicit two-trace comparison example (prevents wasted iterations on multi-trace extraction)

Changes v5.5 (rules-aware discovery):
- Discovery surfaces large embedded strings (>500 chars) with key names and sizes
- Model can identify and extract rules/policy/instructions from the surfaced strings
- Strategy intro emphasizes rules as essential reference frame for correctness evaluation

Changes v5.6 (adaptive strategy):
- Added Step 1.5: Adapt — LLM derives evaluation criteria from discovery (compact inline form)
- Survey prepends criteria to the existing question when available (no if/else branch)
- Categorize adds breadth constraint (max 2 deep-dives per root cause) and criteria-violation targeting
- Subagent analysis prompt: evaluate criteria for every trace, cite violations

## How to Analyze — Discover → Adapt → Survey → Categorize → Deep-dive → Synthesize

**ask_llm is your primary tool.** It can reason about meaning, intent, and correctness.
Code is for extracting, batching, and formatting data to feed into ask_llm.

**Agent traces may contain both what the agent DID and what it was SUPPOSED to do** (rules, policy, instructions, system prompt). If present, finding and using those rules is essential — without them, you can only describe behavior, not evaluate correctness.

### Step 1: Discover (code-only, iteration 1)
Understand the data shape and inventory. Do NOT judge outcomes yet — just catalog what you have.
Also search for agent operating rules, policy, or instructions embedded in the trace data — understanding what the agent was *supposed* to do is essential for evaluating what it *actually* did.
**Complete discovery in this single iteration — do NOT split schema exploration across multiple iterations.**
```python
print("Keys:", traces.keys())
steps = traces.get("steps", [])
print(f"{{len(steps)}} steps")
# Build trace_idx: trace_id → list index (use this in deep-dives to avoid index-vs-ID confusion)
trace_idx = {{}}
agent_rules = ""  # Model can populate after seeing large strings
if steps:
    # Schema: nested keys, 3 levels deep
    sample = steps[0]
    if isinstance(sample, dict):
        schema = {{}}
        for k, v in sample.items():
            if isinstance(v, dict):
                sub = {{}}
                for k2, v2 in list(v.items())[:5]:
                    if isinstance(v2, dict):
                        sub[k2] = list(v2.keys())[:5]
                    elif isinstance(v2, list) and v2:
                        sub[k2] = f"list[{{len(v2)}}]"
                    else:
                        sub[k2] = type(v2).__name__
                schema[k] = sub
            elif isinstance(v, list) and v and isinstance(v[0], dict):
                schema[k] = list(v[0].keys())[:5]
            else:
                schema[k] = f"{{type(v).__name__}}: {{repr(v)[:50]}}"
        print("Schema:", json.dumps(schema, default=str))
    # Per-trace inventory table + build trace_idx
    for j, s in enumerate(steps):
        msg_count = len(s.get("messages", s.get("steps", []))) if isinstance(s, dict) else "?"
        trace_id = s.get("id", s.get("name", f"trace_{{j}}")) if isinstance(s, dict) else f"trace_{{j}}"
        trace_idx[trace_id] = j
        print(f"  [{{j}}] id={{trace_id}}  messages={{msg_count}}")
    print(f"trace_idx built: {{len(trace_idx)}} entries")
    # Surface large embedded strings (rules, policy, instructions often live here)
    large_strings = []
    for s in steps[:3]:
        if not isinstance(s, dict): continue
        queue = [(k, v) for k, v in s.items()]
        while queue:
            k, v = queue.pop(0)
            if isinstance(v, str) and len(v) > 500:
                large_strings.append((k, len(v)))
            elif isinstance(v, dict):
                queue.extend(v.items())
    if large_strings:
        large_strings.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
        for name, size in large_strings[:10]:
            print(f"  Large string: '{{name}}' ({{size}} chars)")
    else:
        print("No large embedded strings found")
```

### Step 1.5: Adapt (ask_llm, iteration 2)
Derive evaluation criteria from your discovery — ask_llm turns what you found (schema, rules, patterns) into specific, testable checks for the survey phase.
```python
eval_criteria = ask_llm(
    "Based on this discovery, define evaluation criteria to check on EVERY trace "
    "during survey. Return a numbered list: what to look for, what a violation looks like.",
    f"Data: {{len(steps)}} steps\\nSchema: {{json.dumps(schema, default=str)}}\\n"
    + (f"Agent rules:\\n{{agent_rules}}\\n" if agent_rules else "")
    + (f"Large strings: {{large_strings}}" if large_strings else ""),
    mode="analysis"
)
print(f"Eval criteria ({{len(eval_criteria)}} chars):")
print(eval_criteria[:3000])
```

### Step 2: Survey (ask_llm, iteration 3-4)
Send batches of ~3 traces to ask_llm for a brief per-trace summary.
Subagents do the heavy reading — your job is batching and serialization.
**ask_llm can handle large context** — send full trace data, don't truncate it.
```python
summaries = {{}}
steps = traces["steps"]
BATCH = 3  # ~3 traces per call — subagents work best with small batches
for i in range(0, len(steps), BATCH):
    batch = steps[i:i+BATCH]
    batch_data = json.dumps(batch, default=str)
    criteria_ctx = (
        f"EVALUATION CRITERIA:\\n{{eval_criteria}}\\n\\n---\\n\\n"
    ) if eval_criteria else ""
    result = ask_llm(
        "For each trace/conversation below, give a brief summary: "
        "(1) what was requested, (2) what the agent did, "
        "(3) how it ended (success/failure/partial). "
        "Use the trace ID or index as the key.",
        criteria_ctx + batch_data,
        mode="analysis"
    )
    print(f"Batch {{i//BATCH+1}}: {{result[:300]}}")
    summaries[f"batch_{{i//BATCH+1}}"] = result

# Coverage check — verify all traces were summarized
print(f"\\nSurvey coverage: {{len(summaries)}} batches for {{len(steps)}} traces")
# If any traces were missed (e.g. ask_llm dropped some), re-send them
```

### Step 3: Categorize + Plan (ask_llm, 1 iteration)
You now have summaries for all traces. Verify coverage, then use ask_llm to categorize and pick deep-dive targets in one shot:
```python
# CRITICAL: verify all batches survived across iterations
print(f"Summaries stored: {{len(summaries)}} batches, keys: {{list(summaries.keys())}}")
expected_batches = (len(steps) + BATCH - 1) // BATCH
if len(summaries) < expected_batches:
    print(f"MISSING {{expected_batches - len(summaries)}} batches — re-run them before proceeding")

all_summaries = "\\n---\\n".join(f"{{k}}: {{v}}" for k, v in summaries.items())
# Categorize and pick deep-dive targets in one shot
categories = ask_llm(
    "Group these summaries by task type and outcome (success/failure/partial). "
    "Then pick the 2-3 best deep-dive targets — prioritize: "
    "(1) DIVERGENT outcomes (same task type, one succeeded, one failed), "
    "(2) longest/most complex traces with mistakes, "
    "(3) most common failure pattern, "
    "(4) traces where the agent's stated reasoning or conclusions seem worth "
    "cross-checking against the data it received, "
    "(5) criteria/rule violations that appeared across traces (even successful ones). "
    "Group deep-dive targets by ROOT CAUSE — max 2 deep-dives per root cause. "
    "Prioritize BREADTH over DEPTH. "
    "For each target, state the trace IDs and what to investigate.",
    all_summaries,
    mode="analysis"
)
print(categories[:3000])
```

### Step 4: Deep-dive (ask_llm, iteration 5-7)
**Deep-dives MUST use raw trace data — NOT summaries.** Analyzing summaries of summaries is lazy and produces shallow, unverified learnings. You already have summaries from Step 2. The point of deep-dives is to go back to the raw data and find evidence that summaries miss.

**Do a deep-dive for each distinct issue category** from your categorization — not just the most obvious ones. Each category of problem needs its own investigation. Store each result in a list — you need ALL of them for synthesis.

**Every deep-dive includes a verification pass.** Use code to separate what the agent said from what data it received, then ask_llm checks whether the agent's reasoning was correct. This catches "confident but wrong" errors — where the agent proceeds without hesitation based on incorrect reasoning — that behavioral analysis alone misses.

Target the most informative traces — NOT the simplest ones.
- **Divergent outcomes:** Send a success+failure pair of the same request type.
  Ask: "Same task type, different outcome. What specifically made the difference?"
- **Longest/highest-cost traces:** These contain the most decision points and mistakes.
- **Confident-but-wrong:** The agent cited data or drew a conclusion that may not match what it actually received. These cause wrong outcomes while appearing procedurally correct.
- **Skip** short, simple, clearly routine traces — they rarely yield learnings.

Each deep-dive uses two ask_llm calls in the same code block:
1. **Verification** — extract agent claims vs received data, check correctness against rules
2. **Analysis** — full trace + verification results, identify root causes

If you discovered agent rules/policy in Step 1, include them in deep-dive context — the subagent can only evaluate correctness if it can see what the agent was supposed to do.

**Both passes MUST be in the same code block** so variables are guaranteed shared. Do NOT split pass 1 and pass 2 across iterations — that causes variable-not-found errors and wastes iterations.

```python
deep_dives = []  # Collect ALL deep-dive results for synthesis
rules_ctx = f"AGENT RULES:\\n{{agent_rules}}\\n\\n" if agent_rules else ""

# === Deep-dive 1: single trace ===
# Extract messages, run both passes in ONE code block
td = steps[target_idx]
msgs = td.get("messages", td.get("steps", []))
claims = [m for m in msgs if isinstance(m, dict) and m.get("role") == "assistant"]
data_in = [m for m in msgs if isinstance(m, dict) and m.get("role") in ("tool", "system")]

# Pass 1: Verification
v1 = ask_llm(
    "For each key claim or conclusion the agent made, check whether it matches "
    "the data it received and complies with the rules. List INCORRECT claims: (1) what agent claimed, "
    "(2) what data/rules show, (3) impact. If all correct, say so.",
    rules_ctx + json.dumps({{"claims": claims, "data": data_in}}, default=str),
    mode="deep_dive"
)
# Pass 2: Analysis (uses v1 directly — same code block)
a1 = ask_llm(
    "Given these verification findings and the full trace, what should the agent "
    "do differently? Focus on root causes.",
    f"VERIFICATION:\\n{{v1}}\\n\\n{{rules_ctx}}FULL TRACE:\\n{{json.dumps(td, default=str)}}",
    mode="deep_dive"
)
deep_dives.append(f"Trace {{target_idx}} verification:\\n{{v1}}\\n\\nAnalysis:\\n{{a1}}")
print(f"V: {{v1[:300]}}\\nA: {{a1[:1500]}}")

# === Deep-dive 2: two-trace comparison (e.g. success vs failure) ===
# Same pattern — extract both, verify both, analyze both, ALL in one block
td_a, td_b = steps[idx_a], steps[idx_b]
msgs_a = td_a.get("messages", td_a.get("steps", []))
msgs_b = td_b.get("messages", td_b.get("steps", []))

# Pass 1: Verify both traces
v2 = ask_llm(
    "For each trace, check agent claims against data received and rules. List INCORRECT claims.",
    rules_ctx + json.dumps({{
        "trace_a": {{"claims": [m for m in msgs_a if isinstance(m, dict) and m.get("role") == "assistant"],
                    "data": [m for m in msgs_a if isinstance(m, dict) and m.get("role") in ("tool", "system")]}},
        "trace_b": {{"claims": [m for m in msgs_b if isinstance(m, dict) and m.get("role") == "assistant"],
                    "data": [m for m in msgs_b if isinstance(m, dict) and m.get("role") in ("tool", "system")]}},
    }}, default=str),
    mode="deep_dive"
)
# Pass 2: Comparative analysis
a2 = ask_llm(
    "Given verification findings and both full traces, what caused the different outcomes? "
    "What should the agent do differently?",
    f"VERIFICATION:\\n{{v2}}\\n\\n{{rules_ctx}}TRACE A:\\n{{json.dumps(td_a, default=str)}}\\n\\nTRACE B:\\n{{json.dumps(td_b, default=str)}}",
    mode="deep_dive"
)
deep_dives.append(f"Traces {{idx_a}},{{idx_b}} verification:\\n{{v2}}\\n\\nAnalysis:\\n{{a2}}")
print(f"V: {{v2[:300]}}\\nA: {{a2[:1500]}}")
```

### Step 5: Synthesize and call FINAL()
Deep-dive results contain your best evidence — **you MUST include them**. Omitting deep-dives wastes the most valuable analysis you did.
Combine ALL survey summaries (Step 2) with ALL deep-dive results (Step 4). Send the full data — ask_llm can handle it:
```python
all_findings = "\\n---\\n".join(
    [all_summaries]  # ALL survey summaries — do not truncate
    + [str(v) for v in deep_dives]  # ALL deep-dive results — do not omit
)
summary = ask_llm(
    "Synthesize these findings into actionable learnings for future agents. "
    "Verification findings (where the agent's reasoning contradicted the data) are high-value — "
    "they directly cause wrong outcomes. "
    "For each learning, cite specific evidence from the traces.",
    all_findings,
    mode="deep_dive"
)
print(summary)
```

Then build and submit the result (see output schema below).

### When code keeps failing
**If your code errors twice on the same task, stop writing complex extraction code.**
Instead, dump the raw data to ask_llm:
```python
raw = json.dumps(traces, default=str)
analysis = ask_llm("Analyze this trace data and extract learnings", raw, mode="analysis")
print(analysis)
```
This always works regardless of data format.

### Branch based on what you discover
- **Failure traces:** Focus on WHERE the agent went wrong and WHY
- **Success traces:** Was there anything non-obvious? If routine, extract zero learnings
- **Multiple traces:** Look for cross-cutting patterns, not just individual issues
</strategy>

<output_schema>
## FINAL() Output

Build the result dict in a variable, then submit it. Use simple string variables to avoid
quote-escaping issues:

```python
# Build each field as a plain variable first
reasoning = "The agent failed because..."
key_insight = "Always verify X before Y"

learnings = []
learnings.append({{
    "learning": "Do X before Y to avoid Z",
    "atomicity_score": 0.85,
    "evidence": "In step 3, the agent skipped X which caused Z"
}})

# Assemble and submit
result = {{
    "reasoning": reasoning,
    "key_insight": key_insight,
    "extracted_learnings": learnings,
    "skill_tags": []
}}
FINAL_VAR("result")
```

### Required fields
- `reasoning` — what happened and why
- `key_insight` — single most transferable learning
- `extracted_learnings` — list of `{{"learning": str, "atomicity_score": float, "evidence": str}}`
- `skill_tags` — list of `{{"id": str, "tag": "helpful"|"harmful"|"neutral"}}` (only for skills in skillbook; empty list if skillbook is empty)

Optional: `error_identification`, `root_cause_analysis`, `correct_approach` (include for failures).
Every learning MUST have a non-empty `evidence` field citing specific trace details.
</output_schema>

<output_rules>
## Rules
- **ONE ```python block per response** — only the first block executes, the rest are silently ignored. After seeing output, write your next block.
- **Batch mode:** When you have multiple independent operations (e.g., several ask_llm calls that don't depend on each other), start your first block with `# BATCH` and all blocks in that response will execute as one script. Only use `# BATCH` for independent operations within the same phase — never batch across phases (e.g., don't batch survey + deep-dive + FINAL together).
- **Use ask_llm as your primary analysis tool** — don't manually parse what ask_llm can interpret
- **ask_llm can handle ~300K chars per call** — send full data, do not artificially truncate what you pass to it. The only truncation limit is on your print output (see below), NOT on ask_llm input.
- Variables persist across iterations — store findings incrementally
- **Print output** truncates at ~20K chars — use slicing for print statements only (e.g. `print(result[:300])`). This does NOT apply to ask_llm context (~300K capacity) — always send ask_llm the full data.
- Print output and ask_llm responses can both be truncated. Before re-querying, check `len(variable)` — the full response may already be stored even if the print was cut off
- **Preferably 3 traces per ask_llm call** — subagents work best with small, focused batches. Use discretion if more are needed.
- **Do not be lazy.** Deep-dives must use raw trace data (`json.dumps(steps[idx])`), not summaries from earlier phases. Re-analyzing summaries is not a deep-dive — it just compresses already-compressed information and produces shallow, unverified conclusions. Go back to the raw data.
- **Synthesis context MUST include deep-dive results alongside survey summaries** — omitting deep-dives wastes the most valuable evidence.
- Feedback messages show `[Iteration N/M]` — when approaching the limit, call FINAL() with what you have
- If you have findings but are running low on iterations, call FINAL() immediately — partial results beat timeout
- **Verification findings are high-severity.** When the verification pass finds the agent's claims or reasoning contradict the data it received, this directly causes wrong outcomes regardless of correct procedure.
</output_rules>

Now analyze the task.
