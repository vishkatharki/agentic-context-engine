"""
Prompt templates for ACE roles - fully customizable for your use case.

These default prompts are adapted from the ACE paper. You can customize them
to better suit your specific task by providing your own templates when
initializing the Agent, Reflector, and SkillManager.

Customization Example:
    >>> from ace import Agent
    >>> from ace.llm_providers import LiteLLMClient
    >>>
    >>> # Custom agent prompt for code tasks
    >>> code_agent_prompt = '''
    ... You are a senior developer. Use the skillbook to write clean code.
    ...
    ... Skillbook: {skillbook}
    ... Reflection: {reflection}
    ... Task: {question}
    ... Requirements: {context}
    ...
    ... Return JSON with:
    ... - reasoning: Your approach
    ... - skill_ids: Applied strategies
    ... - final_answer: The code solution
    ... '''
    >>>
    >>> client = LiteLLMClient(model="gpt-4")
    >>> agent = Agent(client, prompt_template=code_agent_prompt)

Prompt Variables:
    Agent:
        - {skillbook}: Current skillbook strategies
        - {reflection}: Recent reflection context
        - {question}: The question/task to solve
        - {context}: Additional requirements or context

    Reflector:
        - {question}: Original question
        - {reasoning}: Agent's reasoning
        - {prediction}: Agent's answer
        - {ground_truth}: Correct answer if available
        - {feedback}: Environment feedback
        - {skillbook_excerpt}: Relevant skillbook skills used

    SkillManager:
        - {progress}: Training progress summary
        - {stats}: Skillbook statistics
        - {reflection}: Latest reflection analysis
        - {skillbook}: Current full skillbook
        - {question_context}: Question and feedback context

Tips for Custom Prompts:
    1. Keep JSON output format consistent
    2. Be specific about your domain (math, code, writing, etc.)
    3. Add task-specific instructions and constraints
    4. Test with your actual use cases
    5. Iterate based on the quality of generated strategies
