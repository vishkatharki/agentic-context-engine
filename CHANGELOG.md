# Changelog

All notable changes to ACE Framework will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **Playbook format changed to TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation)**
  - `Playbook.as_prompt()` now returns TOON format instead of markdown
  - **Reason**: 16-62% token savings for improved scalability and reduced inference costs
  - **Migration**: No action needed if using playbook with Generator/Curator/Reflector
  - **Debugging**: Use `playbook._as_markdown_debug()` or `str(playbook)` for human-readable output
  - **Details**: Uses tab delimiters and excludes internal metadata (created_at, updated_at)

### Added
- **ACELiteLLM integration** - Simple conversational agent with automatic learning
- **ACELangChain integration** - Wrap LangChain Runnables with ACE learning
- **Integration exports** - Import ACEAgent, ACELiteLLM, ACELangChain from `ace` package root
- **TOON compression for playbooks** - 16-62% token reduction vs markdown
- **Citation-based tracking** - Strategies cited inline as `[section-00001]`, auto-extracted from reasoning
- **Enhanced browser traces** - Full execution logs (2200+ chars) passed to Reflector
- **Test coverage** - Improved from 28% to 70% (241 tests total)

### Changed
- **Renamed SimpleAgent → ACELiteLLM** - Clearer naming for conversational agent integration
- `Playbook.__str__()` returns markdown (TOON reserved for LLM consumption via `as_prompt()`)

### Fixed
- **Browser-use trace integration** - Reflector now receives complete execution traces
  - Fixed initial query duplication (task appeared in both question and reasoning)
  - Fixed missing trace data (reasoning field now contains 2200+ chars vs 154 chars)
  - Fixed screenshot attribute bug causing AttributeError on step.state.screenshot
  - Fixed invalid bullet ID filtering - hallucinated/malformed citations now filtered out
  - Added comprehensive regression tests to catch these issues
  - Impact: Reflector can now properly analyze browser agent's thought process
  - Test coverage improved: 69% → 79% for browser_use.py
- Prompt v2.1 test assertions updated to match current format
- All 206 tests now pass (was 189)
