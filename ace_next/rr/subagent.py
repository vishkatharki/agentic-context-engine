"""Sub-agent LLM wrapper for trace exploration in the sandbox.

This module provides an LLM wrapper that can be called from within sandbox code
to perform targeted analysis on partial traces or data. The sub-agent is designed
to be a smaller/faster model that has no tools - it just receives a question and
context, then returns insights.

The key insight is that the main reflector (running code) can programmatically
explore the trace and call the sub-agent to get LLM insights on specific parts,
combining code-based analysis with LLM reasoning.

Example usage in sandbox code:
    # Get insights on a specific error
    error_steps = trace.get_errors()
    if error_steps:
        insight = ask_llm(
            question="What caused this error and how to fix it?",
            context=str(error_steps[0])
        )
        print(insight)

    # Analyze a pattern across multiple steps
    pattern_data = [s for s in trace if "retry" in s.observation.lower()]
    insight = ask_llm(
        question="Why did the agent retry so many times?",
        context=json.dumps([{"step": s.index, "obs": s.observation} for s in pattern_data])
    )

SUBAGENT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """\
You are a trace reader for a multi-phase analysis pipeline. A downstream agent will use your output to categorize traces and decide which ones deserve deep investigation. It will not read the raw traces itself — your summary is its only view into the data.

For each trace or conversation in the context:
1. **Task** — what was requested or attempted (brief).
2. **Approach** — the agent's key steps, tools used, and the overall sequence of actions.
3. **Decision points** — where the agent chose between alternatives. What did it choose and what were the other options?
4. **Mistakes** — errors, wrong turns, retries, wasted steps. Describe what went wrong factually — do not analyze root causes.
5. **What stood out** — anything non-obvious: clever recoveries, unusual tool usage, unexpected results, or signs of a pattern.
6. **Evaluation criteria** — if evaluation criteria, rules, or a checklist are provided in the context, actively evaluate every applicable criterion for every trace — even successful ones. Cite evidence for any violations.

Cite step numbers or message excerpts as evidence. Be thorough — the downstream agent cannot go back to the raw data."""

# Deep-dive mode: analytical — provides evidence-rich material for synthesis
SUBAGENT_DEEPDIVE_PROMPT = """\
You are an investigator analyzing agent execution traces. A downstream agent has already surveyed these traces and selected them for deeper analysis. Your job is to answer the specific question asked, providing the evidence and reasoning the downstream agent needs to formulate learnings.

Approach:
- **Verify before analyzing.** Before investigating causes, check whether the agent's claims and conclusions accurately reflect the data it received. "Confident but wrong" — where the agent proceeds without hesitation based on incorrect reasoning — is a high-value finding that behavioral analysis alone misses.
- **Check against rules.** If agent operating rules or policy are provided, verify that the agent's actions comply with them. Rule violations are high-value findings even when the agent appeared to succeed — they often look "normal" because many traces share the same violation.
- **Causes, not symptoms.** When something went wrong, identify the root decision or assumption that led to it. What should the agent have done instead — concretely?
- **Contrast directly.** When given multiple traces, find the specific point where they diverged. Do not describe each trace separately — compare them.
- **Cite everything.** Every claim must reference specific evidence (step number, message content, tool output). If something is ambiguous, say so — do not speculate.
- **Suggest alternatives.** For mistakes, describe the concrete action the agent should have taken instead."""
